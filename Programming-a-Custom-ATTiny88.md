# Programming a Custom ATTiny88

Here we'll showcase programming something other than an ATMega328P-based (Arduino Clone) board.  For this example we'll use our custom [ATTiny88](https://github.com/nollstead/Tiny88) - which is really just an breakout board for the ATTiny88 Microcontroller.  

In progress, stay tuned for updates...

# Hookup Guide

Looking to program your AVR-based boards without the mess of wires and a breadboard?  In this guide we'll introduct you to the important aspects of the ICSP and how to program different types of boards with it.

- [Board Overview](/Board-Overview.md) - A look at the hardware components that make up the ICSP programmer
- [Programming an Arduino UNO](/Programming-an-Arduino-Uno.md) - A look at the hardware components that make up the ICSP programmer
- [Programming a Custom ATMega328P using Tag-Connect](/Programming-a-Custom-ATMega328P.md)

## Required Materials

To follow along with this tutorial, you will need an ICSP programmer and a target board to program.  Our tutorials include programming different types of board but we suggest starting with a standard Arduino Uno.  Additionally, you'll need a USB-C cable to plug into your computer and the ArduinoIDE installed.

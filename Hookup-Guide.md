# Hookup Guide

Looking to program your AVR-based boards without the mess of wires and a breadboard?  In this guide we'll introduct you to the important aspects of the ICSP and how to program different types of boards with it.

- [Board Overview](/Board-Overview.md) - A look at the hardware components that make up the ICSP programmer
- [Programming an Arduino UNO](/Programming-an-Arduino-Uno.md) - A look at the hardware components that make up the ICSP programmer

## Required Materials

To follow along with this tutorial, you will need an ICSP programmer and a target board to program.  Our tutorials include programming different types of board but we suggest starting with a standard Arduino Uno.  Additionally, you'll need a USB-C cable to plug into your computer and the Arduino IDE installed.

## Optional Accessories (not included)

While the programmer comes with a standard double-female ICSP cable, enabling it to program a board such as an Arduino Uno out of the box, that's just not something that's done very often.  The real power of this programmer is it's compatibility with Tag-Connect cables, enabling you design and program custom boards that have an ICSP interface with a much smaller footprint.  We recommend using either the Tag-Connect TC2030 Legged or, preferably, the smaller TC2030 no-leg version if space is at a premium on your custom board.  See links below for recommended cables:
